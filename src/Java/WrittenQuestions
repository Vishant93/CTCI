13.1 Private Constructor: In terms of inheritance, what is the effect of keeping a consturctor private?

Keeping a constructor private means that you can only access the private constructor if you can also access that class's private methods.
Ie if a class is an inner class of the parent, it can.

13.2 Return from Finally: In Java, does the finally block get executed if we insert a return statement inside the try block of a try-catch-finally?

Yes, it will get executed, there are only two situations where it won't:
If the virtual machine exits during try/catch block or if the thread terminates during try/catch.

13.3 What is the difference between final, finally, and finalize?

Final is used to control whether a variable is changeable.
Finally is use in a try/catch block to ensure that a segment of code is executed.
finalize() is called by the garbage collector once it determines that no more references exist.

13.4 Explain the difference between templates in C++ and generics in Java.

Generics in Java utilize type erasure, which means the explicit type annotations are removed at compile time.

13.5 Explain the differences between TreeMap, HashMap and LinkedHashMap. Provid an example of when each one would be best.

HashMap has a O(1) lookup and insertion cost.
TreeMap has a O(logN) lookup and insertion cost, keys are ordered.
LinkedHashMap has a O(1) lookup and insertion cost. Keys ordered by insertion order, implemented by doubly-linked buckets.

13.6 Explain what object reflection is in Java and why it is useful.
Object reflection is a feature in Java that provides a way to get reflective information about Java classes and
objects and perform actions. You can get information about methods and fields inside the class, create a new instance
of a class, and get/set object fields directly.
